# ✅ Database Schema Fix Verification Checklist

## After running the SQL scripts in Supabase:

### 1. Database Schema Verification
- [ ] Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'issues' AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```
- [ ] Confirm `resolved_by` column exists (INTEGER, nullable)
- [ ] Confirm `resolution` column exists (TEXT, nullable)

### 2. Foreign Key Constraints
- [ ] Run this query to check foreign keys:
```sql
SELECT tc.constraint_name, tc.table_name, kcu.column_name, ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name, ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND tc.table_name = 'issues';
```
- [ ] Confirm `fk_issues_resolved_by` constraint exists

### 3. Test Issue Update API
- [ ] Start your development server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Open browser developer tools (F12)
- [ ] Navigate to issues page
- [ ] Try updating an issue status to 'resolved'
- [ ] Check that NO error appears in browser console
- [ ] Check that NO "PGRST204" error appears

### 4. Manual API Test (if needed)
- [ ] Update the test file `test-issue-resolved-update.js` with your values
- [ ] Run: `node test-issue-resolved-update.js`
- [ ] Or use curl command from the test file

### 5. Check Database Data
- [ ] Run this query to see updated issues:
```sql
SELECT id, title, status, resolved_by, resolved_at, resolution
FROM public.issues 
WHERE status = 'resolved'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

### 6. Verify Complete Flow
- [ ] Create a new test issue
- [ ] Update it to 'in_progress'
- [ ] Update it to 'resolved' with resolution text
- [ ] Check that all fields are populated correctly:
  - `status` = 'resolved'
  - `resolved_by` = user ID who resolved it
  - `resolved_at` = timestamp when resolved
  - `resolution` = resolution description

## If any step fails:

### Common Issues:
1. **Columns still missing**: Re-run the SQL script
2. **Permission errors**: Make sure you're using the service role key
3. **Foreign key errors**: Check that user IDs exist in the users table
4. **API still fails**: Clear browser cache and restart dev server

### Debug Commands:
```sql
-- Check if columns exist
\d public.issues

-- Check recent issues updates
SELECT * FROM public.issues ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check foreign key constraints
SELECT conname, conrelid::regclass, confrelid::regclass 
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE contype = 'f' AND conrelid = 'public.issues'::regclass;
```

## Success Criteria:
✅ No more "PGRST204" errors
✅ Issues can be updated to 'resolved' status
✅ `resolved_by`, `resolved_at`, and `resolution` fields are populated
✅ API responses include all expected fields
✅ Frontend displays resolution information correctly
